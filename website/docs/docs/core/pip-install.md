You need to use `pip` to install dbt Core on Windows, Linux, or MacOS operating systems.

You can install dbt Core and plugins using `pip` because they are Python modules distributed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-core/).

<FAQ path="Core/install-pip-os-prereqs" />
<FAQ path="Core/install-python-compatibility" />

### Using virtual environments

We recommend using virtual environments (venv) to namespace pip modules.

1. Create a new venv:

```shell
python -m venv dbt-env				# create the environment
```

2. Activate that same virtual environment each time you create a shell window or session:

```shell
source dbt-env/bin/activate			# activate the environment for Mac and Linux OR
dbt-env\Scripts\activate			# activate the environment for Windows
```

#### Create an alias

To activate your dbt environment with every new shell window or session, you can create an alias for the source command in your $HOME/.bashrc, $HOME/.zshrc, or whichever config file your shell draws from. 

For example, add the following to your rc file, replacing &lt;PATH_TO_VIRTUAL_ENV_CONFIG&gt; with the path to your virtual environment configuration.

```shell
alias env_dbt='source <PATH_TO_VIRTUAL_ENV_CONFIG>/bin/activate'
```

### Installing the adapter

Once you decide [which adapter](/docs/supported-data-platforms) you're using, you can install using the command line. Beginning in v1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations.

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.8">

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-ADAPTER_NAME
```

</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.7">

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-ADAPTER_NAME
```

</VersionBlock>

For example, if using Postgres:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.8">

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres
```

This will install `dbt-core` and `dbt-postgres` _only_:

```shell
$ dbt --version
installed version: 1.0.0
   latest version: 1.0.0

Up to date!

Plugins:
  - postgres: 1.0.0
```

All adapters build on top of `dbt-core`. Some also depend on other adapters: for example, `dbt-redshift` builds on top of `dbt-postgres`. In that case, you would see those adapters included by your specific installation, too.
</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.7">

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-postgres
```

This will install `dbt-core` and `dbt-postgres` _only_:

```shell
$ dbt --version
installed version: 1.0.0
   latest version: 1.0.0

Up to date!

Plugins:
  - postgres: 1.0.0
```

Some adapters depend on other adapters. For example, `dbt-redshift` builds on top of `dbt-postgres`. In that case, you would see those adapters included by your specific installation, too.

### Upgrade adapters

To upgrade a specific adapter plugin:

```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade dbt-ADAPTER_NAME
```

### Install dbt-core only

If you're building a tool that integrates with dbt Core, you may want to install the core library alone, without a database adapter. Note that you won't be able to use dbt as a CLI tool.

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-core
```

### Change dbt Core versions

You can upgrade or downgrade versions of dbt Core by using the `--upgrade` option on the command line (CLI). For more information, see [Best practices for upgrading in Core versions](/docs/dbt-versions/core#best-practices-for-upgrading).

To upgrade dbt to the latest version:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade dbt-core
```

To downgrade to an older version, specify the version you want to use. This command can be useful when you're resolving package dependencies. As an example:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade dbt-core==0.19.0
```

### `pip install dbt`

Note that, as of v1.0.0, `pip install dbt` is no longer supported, will raise an explicit error, and the `dbt` package on PyPI stopped receiving updates. Since v0.13, PyPI package named `dbt` was a simple "pass-through" of dbt-core and the four original database adapter plugins.

In the fall of 2023, the `dbt` package on PyPI became a supported method to install the [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation?install=pip#install-dbt-cloud-cli-in-pip).

If you have workflows or integrations that rely on installing the package named `dbt`, you can achieve the same behavior by installing the same five packages that it used:

```shell
python -m pip install \
  dbt-core \
  dbt-postgres \
  dbt-redshift \
  dbt-snowflake \
  dbt-bigquery \
  dbt-trino
```

Or, better yet, just install the package(s) you need!

### Install prereleases of dbt-adapters

A prerelease adapter is a version released before the final, stable version. It allows users to test new features, provide feedback, and get early access to upcoming functionality.

Using a prerelease of an adapter has many benefits such as granting you early access to new features and improvements ahead of the stable release. Innovation opportunities &mdash; leverage new features to improve your work and stay competitive. As well as compatibility testing, allowing you to test the adapter in your environment to catch integration issues early, ensuring your system will be ready for the final release. 

Prereleases also have some drawbacks such as performance issues as they may not be fully optimized, potentially resulting in slower performance or inefficiency. Additionally, frequent updates and patches during the prerelease phase may require extra time and effort to maintain.

To install prerelease versions of dbt Core and your adapter, use this command:

```shell
python3 -m pip install --pre dbt-core dbt-adapter-name
````

For example, if you’re using Snowflake, you would use the command:


```shell
python3 -m pip install --pre dbt-core dbt-snowflake
````

We recommend you install prereleases in a [virtual Python environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). For example, to install a prerelease in a `POSIX bash`/`zsh` virtual Python environment, use the following commands:

```shell
dbt --version
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --pre dbt-core dbt-adapter-name
source venv/bin/activate
dbt --version
```
Note, this will also install any pre-releases of all dependencies.

#### Install prereleases of dbt-adapters on different operating systems 

To install or use packages within your virtual environment:

- Activate the virtual environment to add its specific Python and `pip` executables to your shell’s PATH. This ensures you use the environment’s isolated setup. 

For more information, refer to [Create and use virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments) and [Create a Python Virtual Environment](/docs/core/create-a-python-virtual-environment).

Select your operating system and run the following command to activate it:

<Expandable alt_header="Unix/macOS" >

1. Activate your virtual environment: 

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
which python
venv/bin/python
  
  ```
  2. Install the prerelease using the following command:


```shell
python3 -m pip install --pre dbt-core dbt-adapter-name
source .venv/bin/activate
dbt --version
```

</Expandable>

<Expandable alt_header="Windows" >

1. Activate your virtual environment: 

```shell
py -m pip install --pre dbt-core dbt-adapter-name
.venv\Scripts\activate
dbt --version
```
2. Install the prerelease using the following command:

```shell
py -m pip install --pre dbt-core dbt-adapter-name
.venv\Scripts\activate
dbt --version
```

### Install prereleases of dbt-adapters

dbt-adapters are only compatible with dbt Core 1.8+. If you are on dbt Core v1.7 or below, follow the steps to upgrade to v1.8+ to install prereleases of dbt-adapters.

```shell
python -m pip uninstall -y dbt-adapters
python -m pip install --upgrade dbt-core dbt-common dbt-adapters
dbt --version
```
