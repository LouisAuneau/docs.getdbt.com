You need to use `pip` to install dbt Core on Windows, Linux, or MacOS operating systems.

You can install dbt Core and plugins using `pip` because they are Python modules distributed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-core/).

## What is a Python virtual environment?

A Python virtual environment creates an isolated workspace for Python projects, preventing conflicts between dependencies of different projects and versions.

You can create virtual environments using tools like [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/) or `venv`. This guide uses `venv` because it's lightweight, has the fewest additional dependencies, and is included in Python by default.

Users who want to run dbt locally, for example in [dbt Core](/docs/core/installation-overview) or the [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation#install-a-virtual-environment) may want to install a Python virtual environment.

### Prerequisites


- Access to a terminal or command prompt.
- Have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine. You can check if Python is installed by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal or command prompt.
- Have [pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). You can check if pip is installed by running `pip --version` or `pip3 --version`.
- Have the necessary permissions to create directories and install packages on your machine.

### Set up a Python virtual environment 

`venv` will set up a Python virtual environment within the `env` folder.

Depending on the operating system you use, you'll need to execute specific steps to set up a virtual environment. 

To set up a Python virtual environment, navigate to your project directory and execute the command. This will generate a new virtual environment within a local folder that you can name anything.  [Our convention](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#virtual-environments) has been to name it `env` or `env-anything-you-want`

If you're using dbt Core, refer to [What are the best practices for installing dbt Core with pip?](/faqs/Core/install-pip-best-practices.md#using-virtual-environments) after creating your virtual environment. 

If you're using the dbt Cloud CLI, you can [install dbt Cloud CLI in pip](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation#install-dbt-cloud-cli-in-pip) after creating your virtual environment.

### Deactivate virtual environment

To switch projects or leave your virtual environment, deactivate the environment using the command while the virtual environment is active:

```shell
deactivate
```

### Create an alias

To activate your dbt environment with every new shell window or session, you can create an alias for the source command in your `$HOME/.bashrc`, `$HOME/.zshrc`, or whichever config file your shell draws from. 

For example, add the following to your rc file, replacing `<PATH_TO_VIRTUAL_ENV_CONFIG>` with the path to your virtual environment configuration.

```shell
alias env_dbt='source <PATH_TO_VIRTUAL_ENV_CONFIG>/bin/activate'
```

## Installing the adapter

Once you decide [which adapter](/docs/supported-data-platforms) you're using, you can install using the command line. Beginning in v1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations.

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.8">

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-ADAPTER_NAME
```

</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.7">

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-ADAPTER_NAME
```

</VersionBlock>

For example, if using Postgres:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.8">

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres
```

This will install `dbt-core` and `dbt-postgres` _only_:

```shell
$ dbt --version
installed version: 1.0.0
   latest version: 1.0.0

Up to date!

Plugins:
  - postgres: 1.0.0
```

All adapters build on top of `dbt-core`. Some also depend on other adapters: for example, `dbt-redshift` builds on top of `dbt-postgres`. In that case, you would see those adapters included by your specific installation, too.
</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.7">

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-postgres
```

This will install `dbt-core` and `dbt-postgres` _only_:

```shell
$ dbt --version
installed version: 1.0.0
   latest version: 1.0.0

Up to date!

Plugins:
  - postgres: 1.0.0
```

Some adapters depend on other adapters. For example, `dbt-redshift` builds on top of `dbt-postgres`. In that case, you would see those adapters included by your specific installation, too.
</VersionBlock>

### Upgrade adapters

To upgrade a specific adapter plugin:

```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade dbt-ADAPTER_NAME
```

### Install dbt-core only

If you're building a tool that integrates with dbt Core, you may want to install the core library alone, without a database adapter. Note that you won't be able to use dbt as a CLI tool.

```shell
python -m pip install dbt-core
```

## Change dbt Core versions

You can upgrade or downgrade versions of dbt Core by using the `--upgrade` option on the command line (CLI). For more information, see [Best practices for upgrading in Core versions](/docs/dbt-versions/core#best-practices-for-upgrading).

To upgrade dbt to the latest version:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade dbt-core
```

To downgrade to an older version, specify the version you want to use. This command can be useful when you're resolving package dependencies. As an example:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade dbt-core==0.19.0
```

## `pip install dbt`

Note that, as of v1.0.0, `pip install dbt` is no longer supported, will raise an explicit error, and the `dbt` package on PyPI stopped receiving updates. Since v0.13, PyPI package named `dbt` was a simple "pass-through" of dbt-core and the four original database adapter plugins.

In the fall of 2023, the `dbt` package on PyPI became a supported method to install the [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation?install=pip#install-dbt-cloud-cli-in-pip).

If you have workflows or integrations that rely on installing the package named `dbt`, you can achieve the same behavior by installing the same five packages that it used:

```shell
python -m pip install \
  dbt-core \
  dbt-postgres \
  dbt-redshift \
  dbt-snowflake \
  dbt-bigquery \
  dbt-trino
```

Or, better yet, just install the package(s) you need!

## Installing prereleases

A prerelease adapter is a version released before the final, stable version. It allows users to test new features, provide feedback, and get early access to upcoming functionality &mdash; ensuring your system will be ready for the final release.

Using a prerelease of an adapter has many benefits such as granting you early access to new features and improvements ahead of the stable release. As well as compatibility testing, allowing you to test the adapter in your environment to catch integration issues early, ensuring your system will be ready for the final release. 

Note that using a prerelease version before the final, stable version means the version isn't fully optimized and can result in unexpected behavior. Additionally, frequent updates and patches during the prerelease phase may require extra time and effort to maintain. Furthermore, the `--pre flag` may install compatible prerelease versions of other dependencies, which could introduce additional instability.

To install prerelease versions of dbt Core and your adapter, use this command (replace `dbt-adapter-name` with your adapter)

```shell
python3 -m pip install --pre dbt-core dbt-adapter-name
```

For example, if you’re using Snowflake, you would use the command:


```shell
python3 -m pip install --pre dbt-core dbt-snowflake

```

We recommend you install prereleases in a [virtual Python environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). For example, to install a prerelease in a `POSIX bash`/`zsh` virtual Python environment, use the following commands:

```shell
dbt --version
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --pre dbt-core dbt-adapter-name
source .venv/bin/activate
dbt --version
```
Note, this will also install any pre-releases of all dependencies.

### Activate your virtual environment 

To install or use packages within your virtual environment:

- Activate the virtual environment to add its specific Python and `pip` executables to your shell’s PATH. This ensures you use the environment’s isolated setup. 

For more information, refer to [Create and use virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments).

Select your operating system and run the following command to activate it:

### Installing prereleases

`dbt-adapters` is only compatible with dbt Core 1.8 and higher. If you're on dbt Core v1.7 or lower, follow these steps to upgrade to v1.8 or higher to install prereleases of `dbt-adapters`.

```shell
python -m pip uninstall -y dbt-adapters
python -m pip install --upgrade --pre dbt-core dbt-common dbt-adapters
dbt --version
```
