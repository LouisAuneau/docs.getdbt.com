dbt Cloud release notes for recent and historical changes. Release notes fall into one of the following categories:

- **New:** New products and features
- **Enhancement:** Performance improvements and feature enhancements
- **Fix:** Bug and security fixes
- **Behavior change:** A change to existing behavior that doesn't fit into the other categories, such as feature deprecations or changes to default settings

Release notes are grouped by month for both multi-tenant and virtual private cloud (VPC) environments.

## January 2025

- **New**: Added the `dbt invocation` command to the [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation). This command allows you to view and manage active invocations, which are long-running sessions in the dbt Cloud CLI. For more information, see [dbt invocation](/docs/reference/commands/invocation).
- **New**: Users can now switch themes directly from the user menu, available [in Preview](/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles#dbt-cloud). We have added support for **Light mode** (default), **Dark mode**, and automatic theme switching based on system preferences. The selected theme is stored in the user profile and will follow users across all devices.
  - Dark mode is currently available on the Developer plan and will be available for all [plans](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing) in the future. Weâ€™ll be rolling it out gradually, so stay tuned for updates. For more information, refer to [Change your dbt Cloud theme](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/change-your-dbt-cloud-theme).
- **Fix**: dbt Semantic Layer errors in the Cloud IDE are now displayed with proper formatting, fixing an issue where newlines appeared broken or difficult to read. This fix ensures error messages are more user-friendly and easier to parse.
- **Fix**: Fixed an issue where [saved queries](/docs/build/saved-queries) with no [exports](/docs/build/saved-queries#configure-exports) would fail with an `UnboundLocalError`. Previously, attempting to process a saved query without any exports would cause an error due to an undefined relation variable. Exports are optional, and this fix ensures saved queries without exports don't fail.
- **New**: You can now query metric alias in dbt Semantic Layer [GraphQL](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql) and [JDBC](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-jdbc) APIs. 
  - For the JDBC API, refer to [Query metric alias](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-jdbc#query-metric-alias) for more information.
  - For the GraphQL API, refer to [Query metric alias](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql#query-metric-alias) for more information.
- **Enhancement**: Added support to automatically refresh access tokens when Snowflake's SSO connection expires. Previously, users would get the following error: `Connection is not available, request timed out after 30000ms` and would have to wait 10 minutes to try again.
- **Enhancement**: The [`dbt_version` format](/reference/commands/version#versioning) in dbt Cloud now better aligns with [semantic versioning rules](https://semver.org/). Leading zeroes have been removed from the month and day (`YYYY.M.D+<suffix>`). For example:
  - New format: `2024.10.8+996c6a8`
  - Previous format: `2024.10.08+996c6a8`
